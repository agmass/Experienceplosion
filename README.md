# Experienceplosion
 A (small) server-side mod about experience and explosions!

This mod is **100%** serverside with a custom resource pack, meaning players with vannila clients or [Geyser](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyser) can still play properly!

## New Items

- Captured Experience
  - Right click to throw an experience orb where you're looking!

## New Blocks

- Experience Converter
  - Converts your on-player XP into *Captured Experience*
- Experience-Charged TNT
  - Feed with Captured Experience 6 times to gain 1 extra explosion charge.

### Scolionophobia (and splash potion of Scolionophobia)

Makes the affected player explode when gaining experience!

**To get a potion of Scolionophobia, click the experience converter with any potion.** Adding a brewing stand recipe didn't work since you can't put custom items in a brewing stand, so this is the solution for now!

*"why does a phobia of schools make you explode...?"* ... i thought it was funny

## Resource Pack
- Install [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) (you may already have it installed as a dependency)
- Follow [this guide](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) for up-to-date details on how to host your pack for your specific scenario.

### Bedrock / Geyser

Mod should be mostly compatible with bedrock players! Please report any issues.
